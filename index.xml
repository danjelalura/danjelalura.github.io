      <description>Introduction The End of the second world war led to the establishment of the Soviet Union’s satellite system, which somehow included most Eastern European nations. Countries that were not officially considered satellites by the west, were still steady partners of the Soviet Union and more or less satellite states as well. In addition to Stalin’s commitment to vie for control over Eastern Europe, these nations’ desperate longing to be liberated from Nazism posited fertile ground for the propagation of Communism (Soviet Satellite States | Schoolshistory.</description>

      <description>Can a Kantian be a good poker player if one must lie to win?&#xA;The immediate answer to this question would be: “No, because lying cannot be universalized”.&#xA;However, in order to understand if a Kantian would be a good poker player or not, it is necessary to give a more concise insight into Kant’s theory of ethics. The Kantian ethics builds its foundation upon two versions of the same basic idea: “Act only according to that maxim by which you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law” and “Act so that you treat humanity, whether in your own person or in that of another, always as an end and never as a means only”.</description>

      <title>Notions of Openness - Open Source Software</title>

      <description>The digital era has provided a diverse set of organizational structures, among which one of the most idiosyncratic ones is the open source software phenomenon. Open Source candidly inverses the conventional notion of property by reconfiguring what it comprises. In the open source domain the definition of property is freed from the idea of exclusion and revolves mainly but not exclusively around software (Weber, 2009).&#xA;An application can be considered open source software if the computer code written for it is freely available for everyone to run, examine, distribute, and improve.</description>

      <title>Notions of Openness - The Open Society</title>

      <description>The epistemological concept of the open society suggests that the absolutization of knowledge is practically unattainable, therefore power needs to be eminently distributed. Implementing a greatly decentralized governing model, consequently leads to the incorporation of a more experimental approach into politics. This experimental approach is given rise by highly erratic developments which are brought about through legislation (“‘The Open Society’ Revisited | Issue 38 | Philosophy Now”, 2020).&#xA;The fact that no predictions can be made regarding whether the results of legislative acts will be characterized by inconsistencies, further supports the claim that knowledge is an ever-evolving element.</description>
